5 Principles of Dataset Integrity:

    1. Validity
            Challenges:
            - Out of Range
            - Empty Fields
            - Data Mismatch

        [+ #1 +] Setup Field data type constraints
        [+ #2 +] Specify as NULLABLE or REQUIRED
        [+ #3 +] Proactively check for NULL values
        [+ #4 +] Check and Filter for allowable range values
                -> SQL Conditionals: CASE WHEN, IF()
        [+ #5 +] Require Primary Keys / relational constraints in upstream source of system
        



    2. Accuracy

    3. Completeness

    4. Consistency

    5. Uniformity
