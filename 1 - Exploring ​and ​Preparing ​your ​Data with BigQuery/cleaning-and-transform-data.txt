5 Principles of Dataset Integrity:

    1. Validity (Data conforms to your business rules)
            Challenges:
            - Out of Range
            - Empty Fields
            - Data Mismatch

        [+ #1 +] Setup Field data type constraints
        [+ #2 +] Specify as NULLABLE or REQUIRED
        [+ #3 +] Proactively check for NULL values
        [+ #4 +] Check and Filter for allowable range values
                -> SQL Conditionals: CASE WHEN, IF()
        [+ #5 +] Require Primary Keys / relational constraints in upstream source of system

    2. Accuracy (Data conforms to an objective true value)
            Challenges:
            - Lookup datasets
            - Do not exists
        
        [+ #1 +] Create test cases or calculated fields to check values
                -> SQL: (quantity_ordered * item_values) AS sub_total
        [+ #2 +] Lookup values againts an objective reference of dataset
                -> SQL: IN() with a subquery or JOIN 
         

    3. Completeness (Create, save, and store datasets)
            Challenges:
            - Missing Data

        [+ #1 +] Thoroughly explore the existing dataset shape and skew and look for missing data
        [+ #2 +] Enrich the existing datasets with others using UNIONs and JOINs
                -> SQL: UNION, JOIN
                -> Example: Multiple years of historical data are available for analysis

    4. Consistency (Derive insights from data)
            Challenges:
            - Duplicate records
            - Concurrency issues
        
        [+ #1 +] Store one fact in one place and us IDs to Lookup
        [+ #2 +] Use string functions to clean data
                -> SQL: PARSE_DATA()
                        SUBSTR()
                        REPLACE()

    5. Uniformity (Explore and Present data)
            Challenges:
            - Same units of measurements

        [+ #1 +] Documents and comments your approach 
        [+ #2 +] Use FORMAT() to clearly indicate units
        [+ #3 +] CAST() data types to the same formats and digits
        [+ #4 +] Label all visualizations appropriately
