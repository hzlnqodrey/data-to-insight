Understanding datasets shape

    1. Small datasets

    2. Wide but short (too many colums but have a low records)
        -> to many points to research, but so little data that consectively collected
        -> summary: too many columns and low row data

    3. Taller than wide (too many records but have a few colums)
        -> you wanna enrich your data by giving the exact prediction that you wanna build
        -> so if you just don't have enough fields/data point, you can't summary your data/predict data accurately

    4. Even Height and Width (Perfect Scenario)
        -> Data is properly researched through many aspects
        -> fields are on points
