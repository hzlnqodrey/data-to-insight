List the cities with the most transactions with your ecommerce site

Troubleshoot ordering, calculated fields, and filtering after aggregating errors
Complete the partially written query:

SELECT
geoNetwork_city,
totals_transactions,
COUNT( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS distinct_visitors
FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY

-> Possible solution:
SELECT
geoNetwork_city,
COUNT(totals_transactions) AS transactions,
COUNT( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS distinct_visitors
FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY geoNetwork_city
ORDER BY transactions DESC

====================================================================================================================
Update your query and create a new calculated field to return the average number of products per order by city.

SELECT
geoNetwork_city,
COUNT(totals_transactions) AS transactions,
COUNT( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS distinct_visitors
FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY geoNetwork_city
ORDER BY transactions DESC

-> Possible solution:
SELECT
geoNetwork_city,
SUM(totals_transactions) AS transactions,
COUNT( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS distinct_visitors,
SUM(totals_transactions) / COUNT ( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS avg_product_ordered
FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY geoNetwork_city
ORDER BY avg_product_ordered DESC
LIMIT 10

====================================================================================================================

Filter your aggregated results to only return cities with more than 20 avg_products_ordered.

Possible solution

#standardSQL
SELECT
geoNetwork_city,
SUM(totals_transactions) AS total_products_ordered,
COUNT( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS distinct_visitors,
SUM(totals_transactions) / COUNT( DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS avg_products_ordered
FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY geoNetwork_city
HAVING avg_products_ordered > 20
ORDER BY avg_products_ordered DESC


====================================================================================================================
Find the total number of products in each product category

Find the top selling products by filtering with NULL values

What's wrong with the following query? How can you fix it?

#standardSQL
SELECT hits_product_v2ProductName, hits_product_v2ProductCategory
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY 1,2

Possible solution:
SELECT
    COUNT(hits_product_v2ProductName) as number_of_products,
    hits_product_v2ProductCategory
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
WHERE hits_product_v2ProductName IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY hits_product_v2ProductCategory
ORDER BY number_of_products DESC

Update the previous query to only count distinct products in each product category.

Possible solution:

SELECT
COUNT( DISTINCT hits_product_v2ProductName) as number_of_products,
hits_product_v2ProductCategory
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
WHERE hits_product_v2ProductName IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY hits_product_v2ProductCategory
ORDER BY number_of_products DESC
