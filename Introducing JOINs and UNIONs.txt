JOINs give you fields from different tables

UNIONs add more records to your existing table

### How we create unique identifier of table?
# -> we need primary key

# create primary key by combining multiple column, creatively

for example:

#standardSQL
# is usaf-wban combo unique over time?

    SELECT 
        COUNT(CONCAT(usaf, wban)) AS total_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(usaf, wban)) as distinct_stations
    FROM
    [some dataset about weathery stations]
