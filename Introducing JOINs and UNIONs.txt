JOINs give you fields from different tables

UNIONs add more records to your existing table

### How we create unique identifier of table?
# -> we need primary key

# create primary key by combining multiple column, creatively to create a unique combination key

for example:

#standardSQL
# is usaf-wban combo unique over time?

    SELECT 
        COUNT(CONCAT(usaf, wban)) AS total_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(usaf, wban)) as distinct_stations
    FROM
    [some dataset about weathery stations]

# UNION for vertically merging your data [historically often]

for example:

#standardSQL
SELECT
    stn,
    wban,
    temp,
    year,
FROM
 [some dataset about weathery stations in year 1920]
    UNION DISTINCT
(SELECT stn, wban, temp, year FROM
 [some dataset about weathery stations in year 1921])

Note: UNION DISTINCT removes duplicates whereas UNION ALL keep every record

### WELL I DONT WANT TO TYPE 100 UNIONS

# solution: use table wildcard prefix/suffix (*) for easy merges

for example:

#standardSQL
SELECT
    stn,
    wban,
    temp,
    year
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` 
    # this will reference to all the gsod tables [gsod1929, gsod1930, .... ,gsod2022]

## FILTERING WILDCARD TABLE with [ _TABLE_SUFFIX_ ]
    # All gsod table after 1950
    WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX_ > '1950'

# be as granular as you can:
    e.g: type .gsod2* instead .gsod* if you only care about the year 2000 onward


############## OPERATE TABLE with JOINs

# what is JOIN?
-> Combine data from separate tables that share a common element into one table

for example:

#standardSQL
SELECT
    a.stn,
    a.wban,
    a.temp,
    a.year,
    b.name,
    b.state,
    b.country
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS a
JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS b
ON
    a.stn=b.usaf
    AND a.wban=b.wban
WHERE
    # Filter data
    state is NOT NULL
    AND country='US'
    AND _TABLE_SUFFIX_ > '2015'

#### DIfferent types of JOINs

# 1. INNER JOIN
-> Return rows from multiple tables where join condition is met
