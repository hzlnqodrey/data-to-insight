Exploring newly loaded data with SQL
Next, practice with a basic query to gain insights from the new products table.

In the Query editor, write a query to list the top 5 products with the highest stockLevel:

#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ecommerce.products
ORDER BY
  stockLevel DESC
LIMIT  5

Ingest a new dataset from a Google Spreadsheet
Select Compose New Query.

Execute this next query to show which products are in the greatest restocking need based on inventory turnover and how quickly they can be resupplied:

#standardSQL
SELECT
  *,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(orderedQuantity,stockLevel) AS ratio
FROM
  ecommerce.products
WHERE
# include products that have been ordered and
# are 80% through their inventory
orderedQuantity > 0
AND SAFE_DIVIDE(orderedQuantity,stockLevel) >= .8
ORDER BY
  restockingLeadTime DESC
Copied!
Note: If you specify a relative project name path like ecommerce.products instead of project_id.ecommerce.products, BigQuery will assume the current project.
