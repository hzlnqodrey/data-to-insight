Overview
The purpose of this lab is to show learners how to instantiate a Jupyter notebook running on Google Cloud's Vertex AI service. To aid in the demonstration, a dataset with various flight departure and arrival times will be leveraged.

Objectives
In this lab, you learn to perform the following tasks:

Instantiate a Jupyter notebook on Vertex AI.

Execute a BigQuery query from within a Jupyter notebook and process the output using Pandas.

Start a JupyterLab Notebook Instance
Click on the Navigation Menu.

Navigate to Artificial Intelligence, Vertex AI, then to Workbench.

You'll be redirected to User-Managed Notebooks tab on the main page for Notebooks on Vertex AI.

When the tab loads if you notice a link entitled Enable Notebooks API, click that link to allow the background Notebooks API to be upgraded. The upgrade will occur promptly.

Click on the New Instance icon on the top of the page.

In the menu that pops down, select the Python 3 option.

A screen entitled New notebook will be shown. Leave the default options and click on Create.

After a few minutes, the Vertex AI console will have your instance name followed by Open Jupyterlab. Click Open Jupyterlab.

A new tab will open in your browser with the JupyterLab environment. Select Python 3 under Notebook.

Your notebook is now set up.
