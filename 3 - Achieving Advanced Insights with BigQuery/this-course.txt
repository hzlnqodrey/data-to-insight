This Course will be focused on:
    - Window Function
    - Statistical Function
    - Approximation Function


#### Advanced Function (Statistical, Analytics, and user-defined)

Statistical function example:
    SELECT
        STDDEV(noemployeesw3cnt) AS st_dev_employee_count,
        CORR(totprgmrevenue, totfuncexpns) AS corr_rev_expensses
    FROM
        ''

    ## STDDEV - Standard Deviation
    ## CORR - Correlation [in example above, how correlated the program revenue with total functional expenses]

## RANK() Advanced function, for Aggregating over groups of rows

SELECT firstname, departement, startdate
    RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY departement ORDER BY startdate ) AS rank
FROM employees
